*Gorilla* is a straightforward programming language with a Rust/C-like
syntax insipred by [*Monkey*](https://monkeylang.org/), a simple language
meant to be implemented while reading through
[*Writing An Interpreter In Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) and
[*Writing A Compiler In Go*](https://compilerbook.com/), two awesome books by
[@Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).

The implementations held in this repository are built with
[*The Rust Programming Language*](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and are primarly
intended to immerse myself in the magical waters of
[Interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) and
[Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler),
and also to improve my skills in the awesome aforementioned technology.

## TODOS
- [ ] Improve the README:
    - [ ] Divide the presentation page into two parts: the interpreted and the
          compiled version.
    - [ ] "How to run" section.
    - [ ] Fix possible typos (*english is hard tho*).
